# Nexus Framework

## Overview

- This is a Command and Control (C2) server implemented in Golang. It provides a centralized server for managing and controlling connected agents.
- It comes with built in payloads and a cli

## Features

- [ ] Agent registration and authentication
- [ ] Command execution on registered agents
- [ ] Communication encryption
- [ ] Web-based dashboard for monitoring and control
- [ ] Extensible plugin architecture

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Golang installed on the server
- Dependencies: [List dependencies, if any]

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/c2-server.git
   cd c2-server
   go build
   /c2-server
   ```

### Usage

#### Agent Registration

- Agents should be configured to register with the C2 server upon startup. Registration involves sending authentication credentials and receiving a unique identifier.

- Example agent registration payload:

```json
{
  "username": "agent1",
  "password": "securepassword123"
}
```

#### Command Execution

- Commands can be sent to registered agents through the dashboard or API endpoints.

- Example command payload:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "abcd1234",
  "command": "shell",
  "args": ["ls", "-l"]
}
```

#### Security Considerations

- Use HTTPS for communication between agents and the C2 server.
- Regularly update authentication credentials.
- Implement proper access controls to restrict unauthorized access to the dashboard and API.
