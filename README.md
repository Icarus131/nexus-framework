## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Golang installed on the server
- Dependencies: [List dependencies, if any]

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Icarus131/nexus-framework/
cd nexus-framework
go run main.go
```

### Usage

#### Agent Registration

- Agents should be configured to register with the C2 server upon startup. Registration involves sending authentication credentials and a uniquely generated API key on each run.

- Example agent registration payload:

```bash

API Key: f06e7d075dec24df1ad96bde8f3b98cb726ad564c7b28fc329dffbfa7f369222

#### Security Considerations

- Uses HTTPS for communication between agents and the C2 server.
